## Adding the Research Poster

To showcase your research poster on GitHub:

1. **Save your poster image** to this directory with one of these names:
   - `poster.png` (recommended for best quality)
   - `poster.jpg` or `poster.jpeg`
   - `poster.pdf` (GitHub will display PDFs inline)

2. **Supported formats:**
   - PNG (`.png`) - Best for screenshots and graphics
   - JPEG (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`) - Good for photos
   - PDF (`.pdf`) - Works well for posters

3. **If you use a different filename**, update the image path in the main `README.md` file:
   ```markdown
   ![Research Poster](assets/your-filename.png)
   ```

4. **Recommended image size:** 
   - For best display on GitHub, keep the file under 5MB
   - GitHub will automatically resize large images for display

The poster will automatically appear in the README once you add the file and commit it to the repository.
